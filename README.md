SFQ simulation repo
TAO

I'm starting a repo that has some legacy cir files for SFQ simulation.  
Mostly to centralize working scripts as I found I have many
hundreds of nonfunctioning code snippets from WRSPICE in my various libraries

SUcollab has a a version of compartor coed compatiable with an earlier version of WRSpice.  I have updated this mostly with just junction model parameter incompatibilities with old code.
